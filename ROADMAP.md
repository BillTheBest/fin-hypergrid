*Please note that we are dropping support for our treeview, aggregations, grouping, filtering, sorting and analytics services in general. Our reasoning is defined [here](https://github.com/openfin/fin-hypergrid/blob/master/OVERVIEW.md). These existing services are being exported out of Openfin's github domain, but they will still be available for private forking by those interested.*
